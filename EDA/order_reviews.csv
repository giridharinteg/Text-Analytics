2019-10-25,1758773300188771282,5.0,"Five stars because I love the company; however, my cheese pizza box arrived inside of a 7NOW bag, sideways. As such, when I opened the pizza box, the entire thing was pushed to one side of the box and was smashed. The cheese was slightly peeled off because it was handled without care. I cannot determine if that is 7-11’s fault, or the Drivers fault. I think it was the drivers fault, because he handed it to me sideways at the door. Moreover, unfortunately the pizza was slightly warm at best. Perhaps keeping it inside of a stay-hot bag/box during the drive and delivery would make the eating experience better. Pizza from Dominos is delivered hot, this pizza from 711 was not. In summary, I think the driver dropped the ball; but I am not sure.
